# Welcome to Akiee

Akiee is a task manager that allows you to easily organize your task in an easy manner... It is build with Node-Webkit and Javascript.

What makes Akiee different from other task managers?

* **Tasks should be easy to organize.** Akiee lets you easily arange the order of your tasks. Unlike other task managers, that only let you change prioritys and due dates of your tasks. With Akiee you always know which task you should finish next.

* **Akiee saves your tasks in a Markdown file!** You can access your tasks with every text editor availlable. Akiee doesn't hide your todo list in a database. If you link your tasks to your Dropbox you can even access it over the web.

* **Task in Akiee have 3 states: Todo, Doing, Done!** Inspired from agile methods like Kanban and Scrum, Akiee's tasks have three states. This way you can focus on a few tasks you are really working on.

Akiee is at 0.0.1, it's the first beta release. I have been using it for some time now and it is working stable on Arch 64 bit. So take it for a test drive, if you feel task management is broken for you.

Akiee is heavily inspired by the great Org-Mode and my work as a product owner in a software company.
